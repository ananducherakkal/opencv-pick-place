# Object Detection and Removal with ABB Robot and OpenCV

## Overview

This project implements a Python server using OpenCV to detect objects of various shapes and colors. It identifies objects and connects with an ABB robot to send coordinates and orientation, enabling rapid pick-and-place operations.

## Features

- Detects objects based on shape, color, and orientation.
- Integrates with an ABB robot for automated handling.
- Sends precise coordinates and orientation to the robot for accurate placement.
- Rapid code execution for efficient object manipulation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- ABB Robot Controller
- Required libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`
  - Any additional libraries required for ABB robot communication.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
